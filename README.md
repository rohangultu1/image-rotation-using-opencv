# image-rotation-using-opencv
Image Rotation In this project we will rotate an image by an angle given by user using openCV library in C++. Assumptions: • Opencv must be installed in your machine. • We need to have C++ compiler.

Function Used: • imread() – To read or load the image that takes name of image as argument. • rotate() – Takes two argument “src” i.e. source of image and “angle” given by user to rotate the image. • wrapAffine() – Used in rotate() function. “wrapAffine” function is the inbuilt function of opencv library. It takes four argument.

src – Source of the image file.
dst – Destination image file.
r – is the mat object i.e. output after rotating.
boundW, boundH – are the width and height of output image after scaling it to fit in the output window. • imshow() – To display image. • waitkey() – To make output window wait till any input from keyboard.
